
1. Start by including necessary header files
    <stdio.h> for input/output functions
    <stdlib.h> for general functions like exit()
    <time.h> for time-related functions
    <unistd.h> for sleep() function
    <signal.h> for handling interrupts (optional)
    <string.h> for string manipulation

2. Define your program structure
    How will you handle command-line arguments?
    What data structures will store timer information?
    Consider creating a timer struct to hold countdown details

3. Parse command-line arguments
    How will users specify minutes and seconds?
    What format will you accept? (e.g., ./timer 5 30 for 5m30s)
    Will you provide any optional flags?

4. Implement timer calculation
    How will you convert user input to seconds?
    Will you store start time and end time?
    How will you calculate remaining time?

5. Create the countdown mechanism
    Will you use sleep() or a polling approach?
    How often will you update the display?
    How will you handle time precision?

6. Design the timer display
    How will you format the time (HH:MM)?
    Will you use terminal control codes for a cleaner display?
    Will you show a progress indicator?

7. Implement notification when timer completes
    How will you alert the user? (Terminal bell, message)
    Will you offer different notification options?

8. Add error handling
    How will you validate user input?
    What happens if the program is interrupted?
    How will you handle edge cases?

9. Consider additional features
    Pause/resume functionality?
    Multiple timers?
    Configuration options?

10. Testing and debugging
    How will you test different time inputs?
    How will you verify timing accuracy?
